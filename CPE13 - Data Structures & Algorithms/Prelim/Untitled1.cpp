// Problem:Write a program that ask the user the number of rows of a square pattern. Use @ in creating the pattern and it must divide the square in four regions equally. The south eastern region is blank, the north western region uses * for the pattern and the others are filled.

#include <iostream>

	// Get the number of rows of a square pattern
	cout << "Enter the number of rows of a square pattern: "

	//Use for loop to get the input of a square
	int row, column;

		for (j = 0; j < column; ++j) {
			cin >>[row][column]
