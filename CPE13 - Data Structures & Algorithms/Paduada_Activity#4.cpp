/* Activity #4: Pointers, Reference, and Dynamic Memory Allocation

October 4, 2024

Objective: To use C++ programming language to create a program of pointers, references, and dynamic memory allocation.
To utilize pointers and reference interchangeably.
To analyze different problem requirements in creating program using const function

Problem: Create a program that accepts input for computing the area and circumference 
of circle and ellipse. Use const function for pi(3.14) and use either radius of circle to 
ellipse and vice versa. Also the output of the program ellipse assume that A is equals to the 
radius and B is equals to 2A. Use also CMATH library
